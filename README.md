### üì¶ Installation

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest `Pantheon.jar` from the [releases page](YOUR_GITHUB_RELEASES_LINK_HERE).
2.  **Place:** Drop the `Pantheon.jar` file into your server's `plugins/` directory.
3.  **Restart/Reload:** Start or restart your server.
4.  **Configure:** Important! Edit the generated `plugins/Pantheon/gemini.yml` file and set your Gemini API Key. AI interactions will **not** work without it.
    *   *Tip:* For security, consider setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable on your server; it will take precedence over the key in the file.
5.  **Enjoy:** Dive into the world of divine myths!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Pantheon uses several YAML files for extensive customization:

*   `config.yml`: The main configuration file, detailing all god altars, their structures, core items, and Hermes dialogue hints.
*   `gemini.yml`: Configures the AI integration, including your Gemini API Key and the AI model to use.
*   `trading.yml`: Defines the base structure and instructions for the AI's trading/blessing sessions.

**Important Security Note for `gemini.yml`:**
Your `gemini-api-key` is sensitive information. **Do not share this file publicly** or commit it to public repositories without first removing or redacting your API key. Using an environment variable (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) is the recommended and most secure method.

### üìñ Core Mechanics

#### üèõÔ∏è The Divine Altars

At the heart of every god's power lies their altar. Each deity requires a unique structure, built from specific materials around a sacred **Altar Core**.

*   **Construction:**
    *   Locate the recipe for an Altar Core (often hinted at by Hermes, or found through special rituals).
    *   Craft the Altar Core item.
    *   Place the Altar Core in the world, ensuring the surrounding block structure matches the god's specific blueprint (revealed through exploration or ancient texts).
    *   The plugin will automatically detect a correctly built altar.

*   **Altar of Insight (Athena):** A special altar that allows you to attune an "Aegis Codex" into an "Attuned Aegis Codex," revealing deeper secrets.

#### üí¨ Communing with Gods (AI Dialogue)

Once an altar is active, you can call upon the deity's manifestation.

*   **Summoning:** Hold a **Theophany Stone** and use `/pray [your prayer/message]` near an active altar.
    *   A unique divine manifestation will appear, representing the god.
*   **Conversation:** Continue your dialogue with the god using `/godwhisper [your message]` or `/gw [message]`.
    *   The gods are powered by advanced AI (Google Gemini), offering dynamic and context-aware responses.
*   **Trading & Blessings:** Gods may offer to trade powerful artifacts or bestow permanent blessings in exchange for **Nether Stars**.
    *   When prompted, a magical chest will appear for you to place your offering. Close the chest, then continue your conversation with `/gw` to finalize the trade.
*   **Dismissal:** To end your communion, use `/godleave` or `/gl` near the manifestation.

#### ‚ú® Divine Blessings

Receive the eternal favor of the gods! These are **permanent potion effects** granted by deities in exchange for offerings. Unlike regular potion effects, they persist through death and logout, providing a lasting boost to your abilities.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Artifacts of Olympus (Custom Items & Abilities)

Unearth and forge unique custom items, each with powerful NBT-based abilities.

*   **Pallas' Edge (Athena):** A golden sword with a chance to disarm opponents and mark foes for increased damage.

*   **Queen's Diadem (Hera):** A regal helmet granting passive speed and a chance to summon a "Peacock's Glare" to attack assailants when you're damaged.
*   **The Crossroads Staff (Hecate):** A staff allowing you to launch debilitating hex bolts and warp short distances.
*   **Whisper-Step Boots (Hecate):** Boots providing wither rose immunity, magic damage reduction, strength with magic items, and enhanced speed at night or in swamps.

#### üëπ Mythic Creatures

The world now holds unique creatures tied to the gods:

*   **Abyssal Guardian (Poseidon):** A formidable drowned variant found in deep oceans, guarded by potent enchantments. Defeat it for an "Ocean Depths Gem."
*   **Athena's Owl:** Rare, naturally spawning chickens in specific biomes. They are sources of "Owl Feather Quills."
*   **Night Wraith (Hecate):** A rare, empowered Phantom variant that emerges at night. Dropping "Spectral Dust" upon defeat.
*   **Stygian Guardian (Hades):** Powerful Wither Skeletons that defend the Stygian Fissures.

#### üß™ Rituals & Crafting

Beyond standard crafting, Pantheon introduces complex rituals:

*   **Hecate's Moonlit Catalyst Ritual:** A multi-stage brewing process on a brewing stand, requiring specific ingredients added at the right time and environment (swamp, night), culminating in the "Moonlit Catalyst Potion." Consumption under the correct conditions yields the Altar Core.
*   **Hephaestus' Forge Heart Ritual:** Involves placing an "Unfired Core Mold," firing it with lava, rhythmically shaping molten netherite with a hammer, and then quenching it with water.
*   **Lectern Unlocks:** Place certain custom books on a lectern (like the "Aegis Codex" or "Attuned Aegis Codex") to reveal hidden recipes for core items and components.
*   **Component Crafting:** Discover and combine unique components like "Crown Jewel Shards," "Golden Thread," "Compressed Netherite Ingots," and the "Theophany Stone."

#### üåç World Events

The gods' influence manifests directly in your world:

*   **Stygian Fissures (Hades):** Rare, dangerous obsidian structures found deep underground in Deep Dark biomes. Activate them to face waves of Stygian Guardians and claim the "Stygian Core."

*   **Hermes, the Messenger:** Periodically, a mystical Ocelot representing Hermes will appear. Interact with him to receive guidance on the gods, their altars, and how to obtain their core items. He can also direct you to the plugin's wiki!
